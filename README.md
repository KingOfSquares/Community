# Community
A plugin for managing a minecraft community

⚠️ **Project is in active development and *not* recommended for production environments (unless you know what you're doing)** ⚠️

## Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive yet simple way to manage players and provide useful features that just about every server could use. Community was designed to work with [PGM](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM) in mind and is meant to be an official companion plugin. Though it will also operate perfectly fine on its own. This plugin will always be evolving and providing new features on a regular basis.

## Features
A number of useful features have been implemented:
- Moderation
- Player Reports
- Account tracking
- Friend System
- Teleports
- Nicknames
- Cross-server functionality
- Mutations (PGM exclusive)
- Vanish (PGM exclusive)

## Governance
This project is maintained by [applenick](https://github.com/applenick), with assistance from [Electroid](https://github.com/Electroid) and other PGMDev developers.
